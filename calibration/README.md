# Automatic MATLAB calibration script

This directory contains a) capture scripts that are used to get the images that will be used for calibration, and
b) the MATLAB calibration script that makes no use of the GUI calibration app, instead it automatically calibrates
the images reducing the error to a certain threshold.

It also stores the files in the expected naming convention.
