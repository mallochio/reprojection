# Activity tagging

Carry out the tagging of activities using the "tagger_gui.py" program in order to know the initial and final timestamp of an activity.

## Usage of the tagger_gui.py script

When executing the script, the user will be shown 4 images, each one corresponding to a kinect camera or the omnidirectional camera. On the right hand side there are two tabs (Start and End). In the "Start" tab you can select the activity to start, delete the started activity or add it. In the "End" part you can select the activity and save the activity in a file. You cannot finish an activity that has not started. You can also do more than one activity at the same time. The keys are:

- [I] <> [P] Move backwards/forwards 100 ms on all sequences (this helps check the adjustments so far).
- [J] <> [L] Move backwards/forwards 1000 ms on all sequences (this helps check the adjustments so far).
- [M] <> [ . ] Move backwards/forwards 5000 ms on all sequences (this helps check the adjustments so far).
